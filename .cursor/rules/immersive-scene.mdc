# Immersive Scenes Best Practices

visionOS supports immersive experiences where content fills a three-dimensional space. Use immersive scenes judiciously and only when the task benefits from spatial depth.

### Key Guidelines

- **Select the Correct Immersion Level:**  
  Use windowed or mixed experiences by default and reserve full immersion for content that truly needs it.

- **Provide Smooth Transitions:**  
  If your app shifts between windowed and immersive modes, animate the transition to maintain user context.

- **Respect User Comfort:**  
  Ensure immersive content is within a comfortable distance and does not require excessive head or arm movement.

### Example

Below is a simplified example using a hypothetical `ImmersiveSpace` container (as described in Appleâ€™s VisionOS documentation):

```swift
import SwiftUI
import VisionOS

struct ImmersiveContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        ImmersiveSpace {
            // Content placed in an immersive space
            Text("Welcome to Immersive World")
                .font(.title)
                .padding()
        }
    }
}
