# Spatial Audio Best Practices

Spatial Audio is integral to immersive experiences on visionOS. Use RealityKit’s spatial audio components so that sounds emanate naturally from their virtual locations.

### Key Guidelines

- **Attach Audio to Entities:**  
  Use the `SpatialAudioComponent` on RealityKit entities to ensure audio is rendered with correct positional cues.

- **Tune Audio Parameters:**  
  Adjust parameters such as cone attenuation and distance roll‑off so that sound levels feel natural as the user moves.

- **Integrate with Visual Cues:**  
  Coordinate audio playback with animations or other interactions to reinforce feedback.

### Example

This snippet demonstrates loading an audio file and attaching it as spatial audio to an entity:

```swift
import RealityKit

// Load an audio resource (ensure the file exists in your bundle)
if let audioResource = try? AudioFileResource.load(named: "AmbientSound.wav", in: nil) {
    let spatialAudio = SpatialAudioComponent(resource: audioResource, isPositional: true)
    // Attach the spatial audio component to your entity
    entity.components.set(spatialAudio)
}
