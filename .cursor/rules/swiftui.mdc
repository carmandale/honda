# SwiftUI Best Practices for visionOS

Design your SwiftUI interfaces for visionOS by balancing familiar 2D layouts with spatial enhancements. Follow Apple’s Human Interface Guidelines to keep content legible and interactions natural.

### Key Guidelines

- **Use Appropriate Scenes:**  
  Choose the proper scene type (windowed, immersive, or mixed) based on your content. For example, most apps use window scenes, but immersive scenes are available for fully spatial experiences.

- **Prioritize Readability and Comfort:**  
  Ensure text and controls are within the user’s field of view. Use system materials and adaptive layouts so that windows remain legible at various distances.

- **Integrate SwiftUI and RealityKit:**  
  When mixing 2D and 3D content, embed RealityKit views within SwiftUI using containers like `RealityView`.

### Example

This example shows a basic SwiftUI view using a NavigationView, a common pattern in Apple’s documentation:

```swift
import SwiftUI

struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(0..<5) { item in
                NavigationLink(destination: DetailView(item: item)) {
                    Text("Item \(item)")
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Items")
        }
    }
}

struct DetailView: View {
    let item: Int
    var body: some View {
        Text("Detail for Item \(item)")
            .padding()
    }
}
