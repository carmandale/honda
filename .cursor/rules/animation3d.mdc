# 3D Animation for Entities

For animating 3D entities, use RealityKit’s high‑level animation APIs. These APIs allow you to load, play, and control animations authored in Reality Composer Pro or created programmatically.

### Key Guidelines

- **Use Built‑in Animation Resources:**  
  Load animations from USDZ files or Reality Composer Pro projects using `AnimationResource`.

- **Play Animations via Entity Methods:**  
  Use the `playAnimation(_:transitionDuration:startsPaused:)` method to start animations on an entity.

- **Coordinate Animations with Other Effects:**  
  Consider synchronizing animations with spatial audio or other visual effects for a coherent experience.

### Example

This snippet demonstrates loading and playing an animation on an entity:

```swift
import RealityKit

// Assume an entity has been added to the scene (e.g. via a Reality Composer Pro scene)
if let animationResource = try? AnimationResource.load(named: "SpinAnimation") {
    // Play the animation with a 0.5-second transition
    let _ = entity.playAnimation(animationResource, transitionDuration: 0.5, startsPaused: false)
}
